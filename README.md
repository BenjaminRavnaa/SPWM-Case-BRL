# SPWM-Case-BRL
A repo for submitting an interview case for SPWM

The source code for this case-submission has been provided all in the same folder or repo, either by attached zipfile, or found in this online GitHub repo. It is assumed that the inspector of this code is familiar with basic dotnet CLI commands, in order to test the c# code.


See attached code in repo or zip-file. Specifically the file “TWR.cs” and its corresponding tests found in “Tests.cs”. In order to run the tests, make sure you have the dotnet SDK installed on your system, navigate to the destination of your extracted repo and run “dotnet test” in a terminal to see the results of the tests set up.


See attached code in repo or zip-file. Specifically the file “TWRsql.sql”. The file is set up to be copy-pasted into whatever sql environment preferred. Whether a local instance or through a online emulator(for example https://sqliteonline.com, using the MSSQL client). Be aware that many online emulators do not support “GO” statements, so the segments might need to be ran separately, top to bottom.
